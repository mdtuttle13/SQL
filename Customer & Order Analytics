# In this SQL I am querying a database that contains multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.


# 1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

# 2. How many January orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND Length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

# 3. Select the customer account numbers for all orders placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE Length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

# 4. What was the lowest priced product sold in January, and how much did it cost?

SELECT DISTINCT price, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

# 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

# 6. Which products were sold in February at a specific location, including quantity and product name?

SELECT SUM(quantity)
,product
,SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

# 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT (distinct cust.acctnum)
, AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

# 8. List all products sold in Los Angeles in February, including how many of each were sold.
