# For this project, I utilized a database with multiple tables to perform analytics on this data.


 
 # 1. Create a list of customers, including full names, Customer IDs and Country for all customers not located in the USA.

SELECT DISTINCT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';


# 2. Generate a list of invoices of customers from Brazil, including the customer's full name, invoice ID, invoice date and billing country.

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.Invoiceid, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry
FROM customers
INNER JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
WHERE invoices.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';


# 3. Return a list of the employees that work in the IT department.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM employees
WHERE Title LIKE 'IT%';


# 4. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT DISTINCT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, SUM(invoices.Total), invoices.BillingCountry, employees.FirstName, employees.LastName
FROM customers
INNER JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
INNER JOIN employees
ON customers.SupportRepID = employees.EmployeeId
GROUP BY customers.LastName;


# 5. Generate a list that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice ID.

SELECT invoice_items.InvoiceId, albums.Title, artists.Name
FROM invoice_items
INNER JOIN tracks
ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
INNER JOIN  albums
ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
INNER JOIN artists
ON albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId;


# 6. List all invoices for 2010, include full name, country, invoice total, and invoice date.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, BillingCountry, Total, InvoiceDate
FROM customers
INNER JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2010%'
ORDER BY InvoiceDate;


# 7. Determine how many times was each track downloaded.

SELECT TrackId, Name, SUM(Quantity) AS total_downloads
FROM invoice_items
INNER JOIN tracks
ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
GROUP BY tracks.TrackId, Name;
